# RTL to GDS Implementation of Low Power Configurable Multi Clock Digital System
Design of Multi Clock Domain System using Verilog HDL from RTL Design to Implementation
It is responsible of receiving commands through UART receiver to do different system functions as register file reading/writing or doing some processing using ALU block and send result as well as CRC bits of result using 4 bytes frame through UART transmitter communication protocol
